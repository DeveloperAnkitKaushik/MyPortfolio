# AnkitKaushik - Personal Protfolio

![App Screenshot](src/assets/demo1.png)

I used tools like React, Motion Framer, Sanity, SCSS, and others to create this portfolio Web App. I created all of the styles with the aid of SCSS, and to make it even more impressive, I used sanity, which allows me to update and change the database as often as I need to.
